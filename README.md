# Personality-Based Staff Training to Enhance Customer Service Efficiency

This project explores the potential of personality-based staff training programs to enhance customer service efficiency in the hotel industry. By analyzing customer personality traits and integrating these insights with hotel operations data, we aim to develop targeted training models that improve service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Research Question

*Can personality-based staff training play a role in the enhancement of customer service efficiency?*

Using insights from the customer personality analysis to tailor hotel staff training programs, thus improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction. This research question aims to aid the primary dataset of customer personality traits with the supplementary dataset of the hotel in Lisbon to develop targeted staff training models that cater to different customer personalities.

One advantage could be; if the data shows that certain personality types prefer digital interaction over face-to-face communication, the hotel can streamline check-in processes with digital kiosks, and unlock rooms through an app service, thus reducing wait times and freeing up staff for other tasks.

## Data Sources

- *Customer Personality Data*: Provided by the marketing campaign dataset (marketing_campaign.csv).
- *Hotel Operations Data*: Provided by the hotel customer dataset (HotelCustomersDataset.xlsx).

## Methodology

1. *Data Loading*:
    - Load the customer personality data from the CSV file.
    - Load the hotel operations data from the Excel file.

    python
    import pandas as pd

    marketing_data = pd.read_csv('marketing_campaign.csv', sep='\t')
    hotel_data = pd.read_excel('HotelCustomersDataset.xlsx')
    

2. *Data Merging*:
    - Merge the two datasets on a common identifier (ID).

    python
    merged_data = pd.merge(hotel_data, marketing_data, on='ID', how='inner')
    

3. *Data Cleaning*:
    - Handle missing values by filling with median values.

    python
    merged_data['Age'] = merged_data['Age'].fillna(merged_data['Age'].median())
    merged_data['Income'] = merged_data['Income'].fillna(merged_data['Income'].median())
    

4. *Clustering and Analysis*:
    - Use KMeans clustering to segment customers based on personality traits.
    - Analyze customer segments to understand preferences.

    python
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    features = merged_data[['Year_Birth', 'Education', 'Marital_Status', 'Income', 'Kidhome', 'Teenhome']]
    features = pd.get_dummies(features)

    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5, n_init=10, random_state=42)
    merged_data['PersonalityCluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(features)
    

5. *Visualization*:
    - Visualize customer segments and their preferences using various plots.

    python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.scatter(merged_data['Income'], merged_data['Year_Birth'], c=merged_data['PersonalityCluster'], cmap='viridis')
    plt.xlabel('Income')
    plt.ylabel('Year of Birth')
    plt.title('Customer Segments based on Income and Year of Birth')
    plt.show()
    

6. *Service Efficiency Analysis*:
    - Evaluate and visualize service efficiency by personality clusters.

    python
    service_efficiency = merged_data.groupby('PersonalityCluster')[['BookingsCheckedIn', 'LodgingRevenue']].mean()
    service_efficiency_normalized = (service_efficiency - service_efficiency.min()) / (service_efficiency.max() - service_efficiency.min())

    service_efficiency_normalized.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 7))
    plt.title('Normalized Service Efficiency by Personality Cluster')
    plt.xlabel('Personality Cluster')
    plt.ylabel('Normalized Values')
    plt.legend(['Bookings Checked In', 'Lodging Revenue'])
    plt.show()
    

## Results and Findings

The findings demonstrate how personalized staff training can lead to significant improvements in customer service efficiency. By understanding and catering to different customer personality types, hotels can enhance overall customer satisfaction and streamline operations.

## Conclusion

This project underscores the importance of leveraging data analytics to inform staff training programs in the hospitality industry. By tailoring training based on customer personality insights, hotels can achieve greater efficiency and satisfaction, ultimately leading to a better guest experience.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook Last_Base.ipynb to see the data analysis and model development process.
